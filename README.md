# Sentiment Analysis Project

This project implements sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral. The model is trained on a dataset and uses text preprocessing methods such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization. The outcome is visualized using pie charts and word clouds for a better understanding of the sentiment distribution.

## Features

- Sentiment classification into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories
- Preprocessing of text data using NLP techniques (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results with pie charts and word clouds
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## Technology Stack

- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning and model evaluation
  - `nltk`: Natural Language Processing
  - `matplotlib` & `wordcloud`: Data visualization
  
- **Platform:**
  - Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python environment.
2. Load the dataset and run the code for preprocessing and model training.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.
4. Access the sentiment distribution via pie charts and word clouds.

## Results

- The model classifies the sentiment of text data accurately into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
- Visualizations provide insights into the distribution of sentiments within the data, making it easier to interpret the results.
